Testing is hard, as can be seen in the last two episodes. That's why I looked around for better alternatives and found proptest.
Let's take a look at proptest, a library for automatically generating testcases similar to quickcheck (of Haskell fame). We will parse informal english dates like "4th of September 1927" using Proptest and TDD.

## Errata and improvements

It might come as a surprise to you, but every once in a while *even I* make a mistake.  
This section covers all improvements made to the code since the epsiode went live.

Thanks to all contributors!

## Meta

* I prefer to use `ok_or_else` as `ok_or` evaluates eagerly and [might get deprecated](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51292)
