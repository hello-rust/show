intro: >
  Let's talk about Python and Rust. I used to do a lot more Python than I do now, but I still love it for its beauty.  
details: >
  One of the first things I was missing in Rust when coming from Python were List Comprehensions.  
  It took me a while to figure out, that the Rust way - using iter(), filter(), and map() - actually is a better fit for the language.  
  I want to show you how to port Rust list comprehensions to Rust.
keywords:
  - iterators
  - map
  - filter
  - Entry API
  - List comprehensions
notes:
  - Reading files using the [Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/basics.html#ex-std-read-lines).
  - "[DevDocs](http://devdocs.io/) is a nice Rust documentation viewer. Also supports a ton of other languages and works offline."
others:
  - "[Iteration patterns for Result & Option](http://xion.io/post/code/rust-iter-patterns.html)"
  - Experimenting with Python is much cooler with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) (or IPython) notebooks. I've added an example to the code section.
  - If you really **need** list comprehensions, you could use [cute](https://crates.io/crates/cute), which is a set of macros that make this syntax possible.
