# Episode 5 - Coding Challenge - Balanced Brackets

![YouTube video thumbnail](./thumb.jpg)

Today we will do a quick interview question called "balanced brackets"
  
I maintain a list of common interview questions on Github, that is perfect for some quick fun exercise from time to time. In this case I'd like to introduce you to a task called "balanced brackets", which is some sort of state machine, to check if an input consisting of brackets has exactly one closing bracket for each opening bracket.
