This is the main repository of *Hello Rust*, a coding show by [Matthias
Endler](@mre) about the Rust programming language (https://www.youtube.com/hellorust).  
It is targeted towards intermediate Rust programmers, who have already read [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and want to learn advanced patterns and tricks as well as how to write ergonomic code in Rust.

In this repository, you find the list of previous episodes, the planned shows and the show notes.

### How to support me

As you know, producing content takes a lot of time and effort. On top of that, running a YouTube channel requires getting a lot of expensive hardware (like recording and editing equipment) to achieve somewhat acceptable quality.
This show is free for everybody to watch. If you want it to stay this way, consider donating.

### FAQ

**Q: What development environment do you use?**    
**A:** Right now, I use *VSCode* and the *Rust* plugin plus *Rust analyzer*.  
I've heard good things about the IntelliJ Rust plugin, though.  
Therefore, I might try this setup in the future.  

**Q: What audio/video equipment do you use?**
**A:** Video: Canon 700D. Audio: Rhode NT USB, Takstar SGC 598.

**Q: What is your post-processing routine?**    
**A:** Quite simple. I solely use ~~iMovie~~ ~~Davinci Resolve~~ Final Cut right now.  
I'm mostly annoyed by the long rendering times on my MacBook. (5 hours for 30 minutes of video.)

**Q: What is the name of your color theme?**  
**A:** Usually I use 1337 and the [Github Theme](https://github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme), but that can vary per show.  
I will try to mention it in the show notes, if it's something else.

**Q: What font are you using?**  
**A:** ~Operator Sans Mono~ [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) as a [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) variant

**Q: How long does it take to create one episode?**  
**A:** Around 30 hours. Here's a breakdown of the process:

* 💪 Preparation time: 5 hours
* 👨🏻‍💻 Creating a prototype for the code I'd like to show: 2-5 hours
* 🌺 Prepare office for recording: 30min
* 🖥 Recording: 2-4 hours
* 🎞 Editing: 12-16 hours
* 🍿 Publication: 2 hours

My hope is to get faster over time. Especially the editing is still
painful, although I've gotten much better already. Publication could also mostly
be done automatically and I wrote some tooling to help me with that (see `ci`
folder).
