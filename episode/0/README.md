# Episode 0 - Humble Beginnings

![YouTube video thumbnail](./thumb.jpg)

This is the very first episode of "Hello Rust!". I'm so excited!

It is my lighthearted journey to become a fearless, more effective Rust programmer. And you can be part, too! My goal is to address beginner and intermediate Rust questions and show that systems programming can be a lot of fun. In this episode, I talk about the show and how I started with Rust. The show is clearly inspired by "JustForFunc" and "Fun Fun Function".
