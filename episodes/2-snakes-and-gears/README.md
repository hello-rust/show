# Episode 2 - Snakes and Gears

Let's talk about Python and Rust. I used to do a lot more Python than I do now, but I still love it for its beauty.  
One of the first things I was missing in Rust when coming from Python were List Comprehensions.  
It took me a while to figure out, that the Rust way - using iter(), filter(), and map() - actually is a better fit for the language.  

I want to show you how to port Rust list comprehensions to Rust.

Keywords: iterators, map, filter, Entry API, List comprehensions

## Things I mentioned during the show

* Reading files using the [Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/basics.html#ex-std-read-lines).
* [DevDocs](http://devdocs.io/) is a nice Rust documentation viewer. Also supports a ton of other languages and works offline.


## Things I should have mentioned (but forgot)

* [Iteration patterns for Result & Option](http://xion.io/post/code/rust-iter-patterns.html)
* Experimenting with Python is much cooler with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) (or IPython) notebooks. I've added an example to the code section.
* If you really **need** list comprehensions, you could use [cute](https://crates.io/crates/cute), which is a set of macros that make this syntax possible.
