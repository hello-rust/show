# Episode 9 - Go Vs Rust - Concurrency And Race Conditions

**[&#x25b6; Watch now on Youtube!](https://youtu.be/B5xYBrxVSiE)**

It's hard to put into words what I like about Rust. Easier to show with a quick example about concurrency and borrowing.
Capturing the "Magic of Rust" is not easy. Luckily, I found a simpler way: show how Rust prevents race-conditions and guides us towards a safe, idiomatic solution. We will port  a little Go CLI tool to Rust and compare both solutions in terms of safety, error handling, and concurrency patterns.

## Errata and improvements

It might come as a surprise to you, but every once in a while *even I* make a mistake.  
This section covers all improvements made to the code since the epsiode went live.  
For an exhaustive list of all changes to the original code, [go here](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/commits/master/episode/9).
Thanks to all contributors!  

* [killercup](https://github.com/killercup) added [an alternative approach](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/pull/45) that creates one hashmap per file and uses Rayon's reduce to unify them.
* [euantorano](https://github.com/euantorano) provided [an alternative Go approach to counting words](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/pull/46).
* [killercup](https://github.com/killercup) added [benchmarks](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/pull/48) because <s>he seems to have too much free time at his hands</s> he was curios and people kept asking.
    Here's a quick preview (but also run them on your own machine!):
