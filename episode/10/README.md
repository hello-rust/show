Long time no see. Let's break the Rust Compiler while I work on a commandline tool for checking links, okay? The link checker we build is now a standalone project that lives here: https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee

Hot off the press, here's a brand new episode of Hello Rust, hosted by yours truly: Matthias Endler. While checking links is not the most exciting topic of all times, let's all enjoy the simple things and be modest in your expections. Oh, we also hit a Rust compiler bug in stable Rust (ICE, as the cool kids call them), which panics the program (fixed in nightly).
